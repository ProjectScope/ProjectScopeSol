This is an open-source project built for the Solana Radar Hackathon 2024.

Steps to use:
Download the files and replace all API-information placeholders with your own API credentials
This current build only has CoinMarketCap and X integrations, but for further integrations for more detailed analysis, you will need to create another API connection
and tie it to the analysis process in ai_analysis.py.

To modify the AI algorithm, change the "prompt" within ai_analysis.py.

The current build is very barebones and is meant for modification to tailor to your needs! Feel free to suit it for your needs!
